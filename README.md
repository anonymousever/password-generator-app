# Password Generator App

## Overview

Recently I decided to try some of the interesting Frontend Mentor challenges to improve my skills and create some fun moments. For the first challenge I picked a password generator app as an intermediate one. One or two years ago I completed the same challenge with vanilla javascript, so I have a basic understanding of the main process. This time I tried to focus on that with React as a UI library in a declarative way. The main features are the same as other similar apps, but the strength property is a tricky one that I saw less in other ones.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I had an understanding of main functionality but in a different way that was simpler but not efficient for these days. If I want to highlight a specific point about the challengeâ€™s solution and what I learned from that, I should talk about config or data folder that acts as a starting point or even a guideline for reminder parts. This part of code shaped other parts in an easy and efficient way with minimum actions. For me this is an important part that I learned a lot. After this specific part, I learned how to deal with password strength and how to understand that as a tricky part. And in the last part, learning very useful tips about vanilla javascript itself and reviewing them is very helpful.

## Acknowledgments

I added more research sources for this challenge than before and found useful solutions along the way. Say thanks to the GitHub community and Frontend Mentor solutions that provide very functional solutions for different challenges around the web.
