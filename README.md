# Password Generator App

## Overview

This is my first try of Frontend Mentor challenges, covered by React as a UI library. We have two main features for password generation. The Length and Options that are evaluated by Strength feature. The styling is covered by Tailwind and a little CSS for custom range input. JavaScript is the main language instead of TypeScript, because we don't have any specific features that are mixed with TypeScript.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I had an understanding of main functionality but in a different way that was simpler but not performant. The new solution satisfies my mindset about password generation. It's not advanced but I think it is way better than my previous solution I had in my mind. So I learned an effective solution alongside with very useful tips about JavaScript itself.

## Acknowledgments

I added more research sources for this challenge than before and found useful solutions along the way. Say thanks to the GitHub community and Frontend Mentor solutions that provide very functional solutions for different challenges around the web.
